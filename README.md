# CodeAlpha Internship - Task 02: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the solution for **Task 02** of my internship with **CodeAlpha**. The project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a provided Penguins dataset to explore its structure, find patterns, and derive meaningful insights.

## Project Files

* **`task02.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis, including code for data loading, cleaning, and visualization.
* **`Data.csv`**: The dataset used for this project.
* **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
* **`Results/`**: This directory contains various image files (`.png`) that are outputs from the analysis, such as plots, data summaries, and descriptive statistics.

## Key Tasks Performed

As per the internship instructions, the following tasks were completed in this project:

### 1. Data Exploration and Structure
* Explored the data to understand its structure, including variables and data types.
* Identified trends, patterns, and anomalies within the data.

### 2. Hypothesis Testing & Data Issues
* Tested a hypothesis to validate an assumption using statistics and visualization.
* Detected potential data issues, such as duplicate rows, to ensure data quality.

## Analysis Highlights

This project specifically involved analyzing a Penguins dataset. Key insights and findings include:

* **Data Quality**: The analysis revealed that there were no duplicate rows in the dataset, confirming its high quality.
* **Body Mass Hypothesis**: Hypothesis testing confirmed that male penguins generally have a higher body mass than female penguins across all species in the dataset.
* **Species Differences**: The project explored key differences between the three penguin species (Ad√©lie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap) in terms of their bill length, flipper length, and body mass.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**: The core programming language used for the analysis.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating data visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: The development environment for the interactive analysis.

## How to Run the Project

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/HarshRajGurjar/CodeAlpha_EDA_Penguins.git](https://github.com/HarshRajGurjar/CodeAlpha_EDA_Penguins.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd CodeAlpha_EDA_Penguins
    ```
3.  Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```
4.  Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5.  Open the `task02.ipynb` file in your browser and run the cells to see the complete analysis.
