# CodeAlpha Internship - Task 02: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the solution for **Task 02** of my internship with **CodeAlpha**. The project's goal was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a given dataset to explore its structure, find patterns, and derive meaningful insights.

## Project Files

* **`task02.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis, including code for data loading, cleaning, and visualization.
* **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Key Tasks Performed

[cite_start]As per the internship instructions[cite: 1], the following tasks were completed in this project:

### 1. Data Exploration and Structure
* [cite_start]Explored the data to understand its structure, including variables and data types[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]Identified trends, patterns, and anomalies within the data[cite: 1].

### 2. Hypothesis Testing & Data Issues
* [cite_start]Tested a hypothesis to validate an assumption using statistics and visualization[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]Detected potential data issues, such as duplicate rows, to ensure data quality[cite: 1].

## Analysis Highlights

This project specifically involved analyzing a **Penguins dataset**. Key insights and findings include:

* **[Add your specific insights here]**
    * Example: "The analysis revealed that there were no duplicate rows in the dataset."
    * Example: "Hypothesis testing confirmed that male penguins generally have a higher body mass than female penguins."

## Technologies Used

* **Python**: The core programming language used for the analysis.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating data visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: The development environment for the interactive analysis.

## How to Run the Project

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/HarshRajGurjar/CodeAlpha_EDA_Penguins.git](https://github.com/HarshRajGurjar/CodeAlpha_EDA_Penguins.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd CodeAlpha_EDA_Penguins
    ```
3.  Install the required libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```
4.  Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5.  Open the `task02.ipynb` file in your browser and run the cells to see the complete analysis.
